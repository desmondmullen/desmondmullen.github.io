    My name is Desmond Mullen. My career has taken me many places from learning BASIC in college (where we wrote our assignments on paper because "personal computers" where still in their infancy) to technical theater (sound design) Off-Broadway in New York
    City to being Digital Technical Director on a music video for Paul McCartney at <em>Industrial Light and Magic</em> to IT and data management at a couple of successful Silicon Valley startups in the dot-com heyday to mechanical engineering for
    a solar-electric vehicle, but has always had components of coding, Internet (even before the web), TCP/IP, websites, HTML, CSS databases, and SQL.
