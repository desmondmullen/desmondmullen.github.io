                the good fortune to work with Nobel Laureates, Apollo and Shuttle Astronauts, great authors and famous

                    Space
                    Mission</em> was the most successful. I was the Show Producer, 3D modeller and animator, musical
                director,
                and a voiceover talent for the show. Working closely with Will Osborne and <a

                distribution worldwide. Magic Tree House: Space Mission has gone on to be a popular show in major
                planetaria throughout the world.</p>

                part of the target audience for Morehead so it didn't make sense to do it that way. I decided to write,

            <p class="dsc-portfolio">This was inspired by classwork at UNC Full Stack Bootcamp. It allows connection by
                anyone with the link (commonly you send the link to a few friends). It is very useful for
                coordinating a plan, (e.g., for a night out) and seeing on the map where each person is on Earth at that
                moment. Great for meeting at festivals, sporting matches, and other large gatherings</p>
