                the good fortune to work with Nobel Laureates, Apollo and Shuttle Astronauts, great authors and famous

                    Space
                    Mission</em> was the most successful. I was the Show Producer, 3D modeller and animator, musical
                director,
                and a voiceover talent for the show. Working closely with Will Osborne and <a

                planetaria throughout the world.</p>

                    user.</strong><br><br>In addition to the basic functions of this assignment - collecting user queries, retrieving data
                for the queries, outputting readable
                data, this app does the following:</p>
                <ul class="dsc-portfolio">
<li class="li-portfolio">User is presented with basic instruction and examples of the use of the app if they type <span class="review-text">node liri help</span>, or simply <span class="review-text">node liri</span> without any parameters.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Minor implementation of chalk to make the examples-of-use and search action "headlines" easier to read.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Every use of the app writes data to a log file. Instead of logging the full results of each search, I chose to log only the search parameters (e.g., 'concert-this Paul McCartney') so that log.txt - the list of past searches - could be easily used to generate random searches when a user types <span class="review-text">node liri do-what-it-says</span> without additional parameters.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Additionally, do-what-it-says can be invoked with a simple parameter ('concert', 'song', or 'movie', e.g., <span class="review-text">node liri do-what-it-says concert</span> to get results for the corresponding "default" searches contained in the random.txt file.</li>

            <p class="dsc-portfolio"><em>Homework assignment for UNC Full Stack Bootcamp 2019. This implementation has
                    many interesting features beyond the requirements.</em><br><br><strong>This Constructor Word Guess
                    app uses
                    node and
                    the inquirer, fs, and chalk npm modules to create an engaging,
                    extensible word guess game.</strong><br><br>
                In addition to the basic functions of this assignment - picking a random word to guess, collecting player guesses, and
                tracking and giving
                feedback to the player, this app does the following:</p>
            <ul class="dsc-portfolio">
                <li class="li-portfolio">Brief, clear instructions are shown in black-on-white text when <span
                        class="review-text">node
                        index</span> is first invoked.</li>
                <li class="li-portfolio">The "guesses remaining" is calculated on-the-fly for whatever word is randomly
                    chosen (from the
                    <span class="review-text">wordsToGuess.txt</span> file). This calculation starts with the number of
                    <em>unique</em>letters in the word and adds two. For example, "banana" has three unique letters so
                    while it is a six letter word, the player would be given five guesses (three unique letters plus
                    two).</li>
                <li class="li-portfolio">The <span class="review-text">wordToGuess.txt</span> file contains the words to
                    guess. There is no
                    maximum number of words that can be in this file - the game logic handles picking a truly random
                    word from however many words are in the file.</li>
                <li class="li-portfolio">The game logic ensures that words will be chosen at random and <em>will not be
                        duplicated in
                        subsequent rounds</em> - even if a duplicate random number is generated - until the list of
                    words has been exhausted. Then the random choosing and non-duplicating cycle starts over again.</li>
                <li class="li-portfolio">Guesses remaining are only decremented when the player's guess does not match a
                    letter in the
                    word.</li>
                <li class="li-portfolio">If a player types a guess that is not a letter, is more than one letter, or is
                    empty (he/she has hit
                    return without entering a letter), black-on-yellow text guides the player to making a valid guess.
                </li>
                <li class="li-portfolio">At the end of a round, the player is asked if he/she wants to play again. The
                    default answer is
                    "yes", so a simple press of the [return] key starts a new round. If the player wishes to replay, the
                    instructions shown at the beginning of the first round are, logically, not shown again.</li>
