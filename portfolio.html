                    Preschool children were not part of the target audience for Morehead
                    so it didn't make sense to do it that way. I decided to write, film, model, animate, produce and

                <p class="dsc-portfolio"><em>Homework assignment for UNC Full Stack Bootcamp, Winter 2018.</em></p><p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>This Word Guess Game lets the user try to guess the top ten baby names for any of the last 100 years.</strong> First the user chooses a year, then they try to guess the name(s). When a name is guessed (or not), it is shown in the appropriate ranking in the "girl names" or "boy names" box so the user is encouraged to play again. Pick a year - maybe your birth year? maybe a parent's birth year? an historic year? - and see how many names you can guess.</p>
                        <p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Features of this project:</strong></p>

<ul class="dsc-portfolio">
<li  class="li-portfolio">Guess the top-ten baby names from any year of your choice between 1918 and 2017.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">As names are guessed, they assume their correct position in the rankings displayed near the bottom of the screen ("Top Five Girl Names" and "Top Five Boy Names").</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Name order is always randomly selected so that even replaying the same year over again is still a challenge.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Any and all capitals in a name are properly capitalized - even on a name like "McNally".</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">User can select different difficulty levels to tailor the challenge to their preference.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">After each round, or the completion of a ten-round game, simply press [return] (or click the Next Name or New Game buttons near the top of the screen) to play again.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">See a newspaper front page in the background for the year selected (newspaper is not displayed on mobile due to space constraints).
<li  class="li-portfolio">If you like, you can click a button to see the newspaper front page without obstruction (not on mobile).</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Fully operational on iPhone. Displays properly on Android but I did not finalize the onKeyUp for Android (which is handled differently than computer browsers and iPhones) because it was far outside the scope of the assignment and I don't have an Android. :)</li>
</ul>

<p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Special Features:</strong> This gameplay engine can be very easily adapted to other sorts of lists, for example "the players on different 2018 World Cup teams": select a team and then guess the names of the players. The background image names simply match the index of the list of words; in this game years are used for the index and the matching .jpg (e.g. "1987.jpg") is used for the background image. For World Cup teams, the team name would be the index and the player names would be the values; the [team name].jpg would be the automatically-matched background image. Opacity on the background image is set in CSS so can easily be changed to accomodate whatever jpg files the game creator wants. Opacity cannot be changed on a true "Background-Image" in HTML/CSS so the background image here resides in a wrapper on the body.</p>

<p class="dsc-portfolio">The processSSNames.html file in this repository was created and used to auto-magically output the year/names object that this iteration of the game uses. That HTML file can be used to load and format any tab-delimited file that has the index in the first column and the values in any number of columns after that. With minor tweaks it can do the same for comma-delimited and other data files. The data for this game was simply copied from a table on socialsecurity.gov and pasted into a data file. After processing with processSSNames.html, the fully formatted object was copied and pasted from processSSNames into the game's javascript.</p>

<p class="dsc-portfolio"><em>Why this project is useful:</em> This project demonstrates basic concepts of manipulating objects and arrays for responsive user interaction. A user can select any of 100 sets of names to guess. Names guessed (or not) are arranged in their proper hierarchies, and - on the desktop version - a newspaper front page from the year selected is used as the background and can be viewed without obstruction at the click of a button. The opacity of the background images is adjusted in CSS which was helpful in development. THe background image is held in a container in the HTML because opacity cannot be adjusted programmatically on true background images. The 100-year list of names was simply copy-and-pasted from a Social Security web page and then processed using the processSSNames.html file with this project. That page output a complete JavaScript object ready to copy-and-paste into the gameplay.js file. The user can adjust the difficulty to their preference.</p>

<p class="dsc-portfolio"><em>How users can get started with this project:</em> Pick a year, then type letters to guess a top-ten name from that year. In "normal" mode you get chances equalling the length of the name plus two. In "easy" mode you get the name length plus four chances. In "hard" mode you get chances numbering one less than the length of the name! Correct guesses (guessing a letter that is in the name) do not subtract from the number of chances you have to guess the name.</p>

                <p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Help Luke Skywalker defeat the empire in this Star Wars Role Playing Game (RPG).</strong> For this - our first jQuery assignment - I chose the "Challenge" option. The instructions for the assignment can be found in my github repository for this game. It may be of interest to look at the instructions, I'm pleased that I was able to take this game far beyond the requirements. I was first introduced to JavaScript about three weeks ago but I have been fortunate to have a good head start on the language having been fluent in its antecedents HyperTalk and AppleScript 20-30 years ago.</p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Features:</strong></p>
    <ul class="dsc-portfolio"><li class="li-portfolio">
    I added animations and other user prompts to make the game engaging, not just a
    useful coding exercise.</li>
    <li class="li-portfolio">animations and color-coding of player "chips" lead player through the steps of the game with minimal-to-no instruction.</li>
    <li class="li-portfolio">if needed, instructions can be accessed by clicking the "How to Play" button on the start screen.</li>
    <li class="li-portfolio">responsive design plays well on mobile phones - even in portrait mode.</li>
    <li class="li-portfolio">player sees his/her character's winning-phrase or losing-phrase on screen when the game is over.</li>
    <li class="li-portfolio">gently blinking buttons and headings guide player through gameplay.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">All animations have been carefully coordinated for consistency and logical sense. For example, when choosing an enemy to fight, the clicked enemy darts off to the right (in front of the other players thanks to z-index) to, in a sense, get ready to fight. The player then enters the attack stage from the left at the same time as the enemy enters from the right. They meet in the middle. Once an attack has commenced, the players collide with each other. The statistics display fades out and comes back to alert the user to the fact that it has been updated. Once player or enemy has been defeated, he "shrivels" away down to the defeated enemies area.</p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">In developing this project, one of the requirements was that "...players should be able to win and lose the game no matter what character they choose. The challenge should come from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player." This task was interesting because it's difficult to truly run through all the scenarios and make sure everyone can be a winner. I created the <a href="https://desmondmullen.com/unit-4-game/attackmath.html" target="_blank"><em>Attack Math Calculator</em></a> (see below) to run every possible scenario based on health points and attack points inputs for four characters. To date, I have not found a combination of numbers that truly allows for every character to win (but I may just have not found it yet). I feel that the numbers I came up with for my game make for engaging and challenging gameplay. Like the game itself, the Attack Math Calculator looks and works great on mobile phones.</p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">If you enter the health and attack numbers in the Attack Math Calculator for a set of characters you see in a pre-existing game, you can exactly predict the outcome of every pairing assuming that game's developer followed the formula for the project:</p>
    <ul class="dsc-portfolio">
    <li class="li-portfolio">Each time the player attacks, their Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).</li>
    <li class="li-portfolio">When the player attacks, the enemy loses Health Points equalling the player's Attack Points and the player loses Health Points equalling the enemy's Attack Points.</li>
    <li class="li-portfolio">The player's Attack Points increase with each attack, the enemy's Attack Points do not increase.</li>

<p class="dsc-portfolio">A trivia game with timed questions and a tally at the end of the game. This implementation has five questions to answer but there is, of course, no limit to how many or how few questions the engine can run.</p>

<p class="dsc-portfolio">Here are a few bits I added in addition to the basic requirements:</p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio">
<li class="li-portfolio">works well and looks good on mobiles and tablets.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">as a courtesy to the player, the countdown time is slightly padded according to the length of the question string.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">though it displays the count in whole seconds, the countdown timer is updated every tenth of a second for smoother appearance. In a more complex game this would use too many resources but it does the job in this context.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">progress indicators show progression through the questions (only five questions in this version). These are, simply, bullet points with varying opacity.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">some questions have associated images that are animated across the question display area.</li></ul>

<p class="dsc-portfolio">Please note: Instead of clicking to start and stop gif animations as instructed in the assignment, I chose to have the app run the animations on mouse hover. I believe this approach feels more familiar, natural, and intuitive to users.</p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">In addition to the basic function of the assignment, this app does the following:</p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">REALLY COOL BITS:</p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio"><li class="li-portfolio">Favorites: Any gif can be favorited by clicking the empty heart glyphicon (which toggles to a "full" heart). Favorites are recalled by clicking the Favorites button at the left-most of the saved-search buttons.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Saved-Search Buttons: Users can add their own buttons for saved searches. The really cool bit is that these buttons can be deleted by clicking on them while pressing Option (on Mac) or Alt (on PC), allowing users to truly customize their portfolios.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Search without having to create a Saved-Search button. This is very useful for just browsing.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Favorites and Saved-Search Buttons are saved in cookies allowing them to persist even after closing the window and/or quitting the browser.</li></ul>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">STILL PRETTY COOL BITS:</p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio"><li class="li-portfolio">Fully functional and responsive on mobiles using touchstart event handlers (required for iOS, optional for Android which can handle both click and touchstart). The desktop-only 'delete button' feature is not enabled on mobile.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">"Show more for this search..." button at bottom of page loads 10 more gifs at a time based on the last search parameters.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">All searches include a maximum rating parameter (default is PG).</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Every gif "card" displays the title and rating of the gif. Every gif's ID is embedded in a data-id attribute in the card for use when saving and/or recalling as a favorite.</li></ul>

<li class="li-portfolio">Players can send messages to each other while playing. Players can even use this as a chat application and think of the game as secondary.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">If two people are already using the game and others try to connect, they will be notified that "The queue of players is full. If you leave this browser tab open, we'll update you when it is your turn to play!". The red "waiting in queue" banner turns yellow when the player gets to the top of the queue and gets matched with another player.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Fully functional and responsive on mobiles.</li>

                        <em>unique</em>letters in the word and adds two. For example, "banana" has three unique letters

                        a truly random word from however many words are in the

                    </li>
                    <li class="li-portfolio">Guesses remaining are only decremented when the player's guess does not

                            with any privilege level (user, manager, administrator) to login *from the same prompt* to
                            access their privilege-appropriate accounts.</li>

The assignment called for very
                basic features taking answers from a ten-question survey and matching them with the one closest match already in the database (an array). I took the assignment further and created real business logic that could be extended to a true, functioning dating/friend-finder site.
                </p>
                <p class="dsc-portfolio">In addition to the basic functions of the assignment, this app does the following:</p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio">
<li  class="li-portfolio">An array of sample friends is created at startup by calling a sample data API and populating 100 friends' picture URLs, names, and ages. Sample survey responses for each sample friend are truly randomized for a realistic cross-section of people. This way you get "real" results, right out of the box. Larger sample sets (300, 500, etc.) do not appear to increase the "quality" of matches.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Allows you to select "I'm a male looking for female friends" (or female/male, or male/male, or female/female) in the manner of a real dating site. Friends are properly matched only with those with reciprocal interests.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Sample friends are evenly split between male and female and are randomly assigned a "looking for male friends" or "looking for female friends" status.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">App displays the *top five</li><li  class="li-portfolio">closest matches to the user's survey answers.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Displays the *actual match-percentage</li><li  class="li-portfolio">(the amount of difference in comparing your answers to the friend) for each of those matches.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Allows you to click-to-compare your answers with a match's answers.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Characterizes the difference between your answers and the match's answers, e.g., "Jane agrees a little more with this question.", "The two of you completely disagree on this question!".</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Allows you to view the matches again, even after you have closed the modal display of the matches.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Full input validation including age limit and true photo URL validation.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Photo URL validation is done by doing a server-side GET on the photo URL and seeing if we get a "success" response or an error. While, in this implementation, it doesn't truly check that the URL is *an image*, it does check that the URL is completely valid and accessible.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">The question HTML markup is created on-the-fly when the page loads. The question text is kept in an array and can be easily changed by replacing the array. (Though, clearly, you want all participants to be answering the *same</li><li  class="li-portfolio">set of questions!)</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">"Help with Images" button provides helpful explanatory text along with a button to click to paste a valid sample image URL into the images field if the user doesn't have or doesn't want to use an image URL of their own.</li>

                <p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Eat-Da-Burger is an exercise in full stack development skills with a focus on Node.js, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, and SQL.</strong></p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">Uses Node, Express, Handlebars, Sequelize, SQL, and an MVC design pattern. Node, Express and Sequelize query and route the data, Handlebars is used to generate HTML. A JawsDB MySQL add-on supplies the SQL component in the Heroku deployment.</p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">Users can "Add a Burger" by first clicking the "Select or add your name" button, then entering a burger name of their choosing. Their burger is then added to the "Burgers that have been created" list along with their name as maker. Users can click "Devour this burger" and select or add their name to devour any burger that has been created and not yet devoured. Clicking "Devour..." moves the burger into the "Hall of Fame" where the maker and eater of the burger are displayed with the burger name. "Gameplay" is not the point here, it's all about the internal workings and interplay of the front-end, server-side, and SQL components.</p>
<p class="dsc-portfolio">In addition to the requirements of the assignment, I added a fade-out and fade-in animation representing the burger getting devoured and then showing up in the Hall of Fame list of devoured burgers. This ended up being way more complex than I would have imagined but was a fun challenge. Doing these animations required adding a column to the database table, doing "multiple statements" in each SQL query, and some cleverness with the Handlebars code. It looks simple but it's fairly involved. I like that it makes clear what happens when a burger gets "devoured".</p>

                <p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>goTreeUrself is a site promoting the importance of planting trees to help renew resources lost to mass deforestation.</strong> Encouraging people to plant a tree clearly has value but, for most people, it is an abstract idea. By putting "pins" on a map showing where others have planted trees, goTreeUrself encourages participation and lets users show the world trees they care about - either ones they have planted or ones that are important in their lives (e.g., "My grandfather planted this tree when he and grandmother got married"). Adding 15 "Famous Trees" (denoted by white arrows) gives another perspective on the environmental importance, historical importance, outsized lifespans and dimensions, and the wonder and beauty of the trees that surround us.</p>

<p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio"><li class="li-portfolio">Users can register and upload pictures of their own trees.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Geotags embedded in uploaded pictures are used to locate the trees on the map.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">When geotag data is not available, we ask the user for the closest address to the tree. Users can enter as much or little location data as they prefer. We use that data to geocode and locate the tree on the map.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Users can add a short biography statement about themselves and upload a profile picture if they like.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Each tree can be cataloged with the date planted, a name or statement (e.g., "In memory of my father"), and the type of tree (e.g., elm, yew, pine, fir, etc.).</li></ul>

<p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Future enhancements</strong></p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio"><li class="li-portfolio">We would like to encourage community among the users of this site by letting them search for other users/trees based on cohort (timeframe when tree was planted), or tree type, or even tags such as "Memorial", "Dedication", "Rare", "Fruit", etc.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Presently, you can see a picture and basic information about any tree on the map. In future it would be nice to be able to visit other users' profile pages and even contact other like-minded users.</li></ul>

<p class="dsc-portfolio"><strong>Technologies</strong></p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio"><li class="li-portfolio">Google Maps was central to our display of users' trees. We expanded the possibilities of basic markers by making the markers clickable to show infowindows and double-clickable to recenter and zoom-in. Each infowindow contains info about the tree and a click-to-enlarge picture. The Famous Trees contain links to Wikipedia pages giving more background on the trees.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Filestack was used for photo upload to give a variety of ways for users to upload their pictures (from their device, from a link, from Facebook, etc.) and for us to extract any existing EXIF geotag data.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Foundation and CSS Grid were used to arrange and style the front end.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Node, Handlebars, Sequelize, mySQL2, and JawsDB were used and the site was deployed on Heroku.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">Sample data including user's names, username/passwords, profile pictures, tree names, planted-dates, and latitude/longitude locations were compiled using the randomUser API and latitude/longitude combinations were tested to see if they were on land using the geoNames API. We excluded Antarctic latitudes for, while they may be on land, we felt it was unlikely that many people would try planting trees there.</li>
<li class="li-portfolio">A list of famous trees on MentalFloss.com was the inspiration and source of our plotting 15 famous trees.</li></ul>

                        2019.</em><br><br><strong>sipSpot is proof-of-concept for a mobile app that helps you remember your things, track your drinks, invite your friends, and get home safe.</strong> The next step for sipSpot is to make it a truly Native application. Currently it has full function on iOS and Android except updating in the background. Making it a Native app will resolve the update-in-background issue.</p>
<ul class="dsc-portfolio">
    <li  class="li-portfolio">With <em>CheckIn</em>, sipSpot will alert you as you start to leave the area, reminding you to make sure you've collected a credit card you may have left for a tab, or remembered your jacket, your friends, etc.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">If your BAC goes over thresholds you choose, sipSpot can give you a gentle reminder (with a link to Uber!) or even automatically send a friend a notification with a link to your location on Google Maps.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">One click of the <em>Uber</em> button opens your phone's Uber app with your location auto-filled.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Ask your friends to join you! Simply click <em>Friends</em> to auto-fill a text message with a Google Maps link with your location.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Click <em>Menu</em> at the top left to change thresholds for Alerts, view History, or change your Settings (including weight and gender for more-accurate BAC calculations).</li>
