                        Space
                        Mission</em> was the most successful. I was the Show Producer, 3D modeller and animator, musical
                    director, and a voiceover talent for the show. Working closely with Will Osborne and <a

                    distribution worldwide. Magic Tree House: Space Mission has gone on to be a popular show in major

                    children and wanted to do a science education show for young children with Morehead Planetarium.
                    Preschool children were not part of the target audience for Morehead
                    so it didn't make sense to do it that way. I decided to write, film, model, animate, produce and
                    publish
                    it myself and have been very gratified with the response.</p>

                    picking a random word to guess, collecting player guesses, and tracking and giving feedback to the
                    player - this app does the following:</p>
                <ul class="dsc-portfolio">
                    <li class="li-portfolio">Brief, clear instructions are shown in black-on-white text when <span

                    <li class="li-portfolio">The "guesses remaining" is calculated on-the-fly for whatever word is

                        chosen (from the
                        <span class="review-text">wordsToGuess.txt</span> file). This calculation starts with the number
                        of
                        <em>unique</em>letters in the word and adds two. For example, "banana" has three unique letters
                        so
                        while it is a six letter word, the player would be given five guesses (three unique letters plus
                        two).
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-portfolio">The <span class="review-text">wordToGuess.txt</span> file contains the
                        words to
                        guess. There is no maximum number of words that can be in this file - the game logic handles
                        picking
                        a truly random word from however many words are in the
                        file.</li>
                    <li class="li-portfolio">The game logic ensures that words will be chosen at random and <em>will not
                            be
                            duplicated in
                            subsequent rounds</em> - even if a duplicate random number is generated - until the list of
                        words has been exhausted. Then the random choosing and non-duplicating cycle starts over again.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-portfolio">Guesses remaining are only decremented when the player's guess does not
                        match a
                        letter in the word.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-portfolio">If a player types a guess that is not a letter, is more than one letter, or
                        is
                        empty (he/she has hit return without entering a letter), black-on-yellow text guides the player
                        to
                        making a valid guess.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li-portfolio">At the end of a round, the player is asked if he/she wants to play again.
                        The
                        default answer is "yes", so a simple press of the [return] key starts a new round. If the player
                        wishes to replay, the instructions shown at the beginning of
                        the first round are, logically, not shown again.</li>

Sample survey responses for each sample friend are truly randomized for a realistic cross-section of people. This way you get "real" results, right out of the box. Larger sample sets (300, 500, etc.) do not appear to increase the "quality" of matches.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Allows you to select "I'm a male looking for female friends" (or female/male, or male/male, or female/female) in the manner of a real dating site. Friends are properly matched only with those with reciprocal interests.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Sample friends are evenly split between male and female and are randomly assigned a "looking for male friends" or "looking for female friends" status.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">App displays the *top five</li><li  class="li-portfolio">closest matches to the user's survey answers.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Displays the *actual match-percentage</li><li  class="li-portfolio">(the amount of difference in comparing your answers to the friend) for each of those matches.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Allows you to click-to-compare your answers with a match's answers.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Characterizes the difference between your answers and the match's answers, e.g., "Jane agrees a little more with this question.", "The two of you completely disagree on this question!".</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Allows you to view the matches again, even after you have closed the modal display of the matches.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Full input validation including age limit and true photo URL validation.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">Photo URL validation is done by doing a server-side GET on the photo URL and seeing if we get a "success" response or an error. While, in this implementation, it doesn't truly check that the URL is *an image*, it does check that the URL is completely valid and accessible.</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">The question HTML markup is created on-the-fly when the page loads. The question text is kept in an array and can be easily changed by replacing the array. (Though, clearly, you want all participants to be answering the *same</li><li  class="li-portfolio">set of questions!)</li>
<li  class="li-portfolio">"Help with Images" button provides helpful explanatory text along with a button to click to paste a valid sample image URL into the images field if the user doesn't have or doesn't want to use an image URL of their own.</li>
