                <strong>My digital path in life</strong> has gone from learning to code on Dad's Apple II Plus, to being
                Digital Technical Director on a music video for Paul McCartney, to coding with JavaScript precursors in
                two Silicon Valley startups, to digital show production at a world-famous planetarium, to UNC's
                excellent bootcamp to polish my skills, and finally to skilled MERN developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                My detail-oriented, comprehensive approach has consistently yielded significant improvements in products
                and processes, and strong realizations of initial designs and concepts. What has driven me consistently
                and connected all these points in my career are the components of creative problem-solving, cutting-edge
                tech, coding, logic, and delivering innovative solutions. For me, MERN development is the
                bringing-together of all these disciplines into one.
