                    <strong>My digital path in life</strong> has gone from learning BASIC in college (where we wrote
                    our assignments on paper because
                    "personal computers" were still in their infancy) to being <em>Digital Technical Director</em> on a
                    music video for Paul McCartney to Silicon Valley to digital show production at a planetarium and
                    many places in-between, but has always
                    had components of cutting-edge tech, Internet, and building useful tools.
