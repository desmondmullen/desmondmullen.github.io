                <strong>My digital path in life</strong> has gone from learning BASIC in college (where we wrote our assignments on paper because "personal computers" were still in their infancy) to being <em>Digital Technical Director</em> on a music
                video for Paul McCartney to Silicon Valley to digital show production at a planetarium and many places in-between, but has always had components of cutting-edge tech, coding, Internet (even before the web), TCP/IP, websites, HTML, CSS
                databases, and SQL.
