            <strong>My digital path in life</strong> has gone from learning BASIC in college (where we wrote our
            assignments on paper because "personal computers" were still in their infancy) to being <em>Digital
                Technical Director</em> on a
            music video for Paul McCartney to Silicon Valley to digital show production at a planetarium and many
            places
            in-between, but has always had components of cutting-edge tech, Internet, and building useful tools.
